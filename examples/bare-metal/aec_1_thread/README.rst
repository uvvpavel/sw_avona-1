aec_1_thread
=========================

This example demonstrates how AEC functions are called on a single thread to process data through the AEC stage of a pipeline.

In it, a 32-bit, 4 channel wav file input.wav is read and processed through the AEC stage frame by frame.
The AEC is configured for 2 mic input channels, 2 reference input channels, 10 phase main filter and a 5 phase shadow 
filter.
The input file input.wav has 2 channels of mic input followed by 2 channels of reference input.
Echo cancelled version of the mic input is generated as the AEC output and written to the output.wav file.

Building
********

After configuring the CMake project, the following commands can be used from the
`fwk_voice/examples/bare-metal/aec_1_thread` directory to build and run this example application using the XCORE-AI-EXPLORER board as a target:

::
    
    cd ../../../build
    make fwk_voice_example_bare_metal_aec_1_thread
    cd ../examples/bare-metal/aec_1_thread
    python ../shared_src/python/run_xcoreai.py ../../../build/examples/bare-metal/aec_1_thread/bin/fwk_voice_example_bare_metal_aec_1_thread.xe --input ../shared_src/test_streams/aec_example_input.wav


Output
------

The output file output.wav is generated in the `fwk_voice/examples/bare-metal/aec_1_thread` directory. The input file
input.wav is also present in the same directory. View output.wav and input.wav in Audacity to compare the echo cancelled
output against the microphone input.
